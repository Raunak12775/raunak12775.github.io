With the advent of Ukraine war there is a huge political shift everywhere around the world. I am seeing global leaders shifting their blocs within a blink of an eye. This is not an unknown fact that politicians are the most fastest dress changers. But the obscenity of it is even more evident. The west bloc that comprises of European Union (EU) and United States (US) mostly (*to some extent Japan, Taiwan and South Korea and all those who have US bases in their countries*) is more shameless about the human rights they voice for. But anyways I am interested about the current situations, so I will stick to it. Very recently, the NATO secretary general called Trump the Daddy of the west bloc. Funnily, the leaders as well as the citizens of the west bloc, who were very concerned about the winning of Donald J. Trump in the last US elections, all of a sudden, sees hope in him. This might seem very weird but in politics it is often coined as **diplomacy**. 

The next event that happens is that Ursula von der Leyen the chief of EU goes to US and brokers a trade deal that can become problematic for the steel as well as car industry for Germany and also for many more industries in EU. But she anyways accepts all the terms of Trump and comes back home. Recently, if you notice, all the european parliamentarians are working hand-in-hand from right to left, for eg from Meloni to Starmer via Merz or Macron, to make "Security Guarantees" for EU. Now those security guarantees are very vague in shape, nobody has discussed how US is going to give it. But they are all very sure about Trump being their DADDY!

The reason for my monologue is that somehow I believe that these EU leaders are putting too much trust in Trump. On the other hand Trump is only there for his own optics. How would he get the Nobel Peace Prize? How would he become well known to world by the title of "saviour of the world"? In reality he is not the saviour, rather he is making foundation beds for the rest of the wars that are going to come. He has all the possibilities to get himself out of the situation and tell the Europeans that he has done enough but could not solve it, so now it's their problem and tell everyone goodbye. In the meantime, what EU is doing wrong by betting on US only and pushing the African Union, India and China to the opposite court, would lose the friends they would actually need in proper time. It is evident that all of the countries that EU is unfriending at the moment has major issues in their political system. But at the same time, EU itself has its own problems too, in terms of christian nationalism, muslim hatred, anti-black sentiment etc. If Russia is needed to be stopped it has to be done taking everyone to one side and russia on the other. In that case, even if US backs off, all the other parties are anyways stronger together than Russia alone. But betting on US only, which also reveals the white nationalistic mentality of EU, will bring more unpeace at the end.
