## How to navigate?

### Big Book

The category **big-book** is like a dynamic book where I add stuffs in a continuous manner, and not in discrete articles.  

### Brownpapers, Greenpapers and Bluepapers

All the article type posts are categorised into 3 groups - brownpaper, whitepaper and bluepaper. Every article is in `PDF` file format. The explanation of different kinds of paper are as follows

1. **brownpapers** - these are tutorials or lecture notes for computational/theoretical chemistry and related topics
2. **greenpapers** - these would be mainly related to modern day research - basically my paper reading thoughts (**Opinions Warning!**)
3. **bluepapers** - these are notes from topics that are applied in computational chemistry
