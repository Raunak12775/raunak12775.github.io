### Note

All the articles are categorised into 3 groups - brownpaper, whitepaper and bluepaper. Every article has a link on the top-right section, pressing which one can download the articles in `PDF` file format. The explanation of different kinds of papers are as follows

1. **brownpaper** - these are tutorials or lecture notes for computational/theoretical chemistry and related topics
2. **whitepaper** - nowadays, big-tech companies use this as a term for research papers, I like it, so it would be mainly related to modern day research
3. **bluepaper** - these are notes and updates related to programming and related computational tools
