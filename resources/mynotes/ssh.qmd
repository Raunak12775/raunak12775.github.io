## Passwordless ssh login

First open terminal and check whether you have a ssh key in your local laptop/desktop by checking ~/.ssh folder. And then if not then follow the steps:

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
this will generate two files id_pub and id_pub.rsa

::: {.callout-note}
If the passphrase is kept empty, **recommended** is to give a password to secure the ssh key.
:::

```bash
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@hostname
```

type the password for the hostmachine login and probably it should be done. Last but least check that the contents of id_pub.rsa has copied the same content in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file in your remote host.

## Github or Gitlab ssh keys

For passwordless logins and git push and pulls one can copy+paste the contents of id_pub.rsa into the github or gitlab authorization places to push and pull without password

::: {.callout-tip}
`ssh` cloning is much better than `http`
