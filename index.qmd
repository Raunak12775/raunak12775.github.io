I am currently a Ph.D. student of Theoretical Chemistry at **Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany**. For full research and academic profile look into my [Bio](resources/bio.qmd). I have expertise in using **Multiresolution Analysis for studying molecules in strong magnetic fields**. For a detailed  overview of my research look into my [Research](resources/research.qmd). My research interest is primarily concerned with the understanding of chemical bonding and its philosophical aspects.  I love writing **pedagogic articles/essays on quantum chemistry** (_look into_ [Learn](resources/learn.qmd)).

For peeping ;) into my opinions look into my [Blog](resources/blog.qmd). For collaborations or queries send me an [email](mailto:raunak.farhaz@hu-berlin.de).
