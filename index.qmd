I am doing my Ph.D. in Theoretical Chemistry at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany. My work interest lies in developing methods for electronic structure methods in extreme magnetic fields and pedagogy in Quantum Chemistry. I am trying to write a book which soon maybe make it to the desk of a publisher (if I manage to finish it XD). Currently stationed in Berlin. Teaching and reading are my passion.
