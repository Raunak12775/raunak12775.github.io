I am doing my Ph.D. in Theoretical Chemistry at **Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany**. My work interest lies in *understanding chemical bonding in extreme magnetic fields* using numerical electronic structure methods namely **Multiresolution Analysis**. I love to write **pedagogic quantum chemistry lecture notes**. I am trying to write a book which soon make it to the desk of a publisher (if I manage to finish it XD). Currently stationed in **Berlin**. For collaborations or fun-projects hit me up at my email.
