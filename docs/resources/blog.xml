<section id="berlin-to-frankfurt" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="berlin-to-frankfurt">Berlin to Frankfurt</h2>
<p>Charlotte is sleeping and I am typing down this memory into an obsidian note app. This is a good app and for the first time I got something that can typeset equation with my android tablet. Pretty good. We are reaching Hildesheim, let’s see where the journey takes us. The future is unsure and in which I am going to put my steps on. I also did the same things before in my life but still I am optimistic as always.</p>
</section>
<section id="frankfurt-to-kolkata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="frankfurt-to-kolkata">Frankfurt to Kolkata</h2>
<p>The flight from Frankfurt to Dubai was really smooth. But I was a bit worried because the carrier was from Boeing 777 and from the recent incidents of South Korea and Azerbaijan airlines. But touchwood we flew well. There was a few turbulence but the overall flight was enjoyable. We watched a movie “Star Wars: rogue one” and played chinese checkers. Now we landed in Dubai and now we are on board flight to Kolkata. Very soon we will reach Kolkata when probably me and Charlotte might be sleeping on the cloudy laps.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to meet Maa, Abbu and Ridh and also everyone in Suri.</p>
</section>
<section id="kolkata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kolkata">Kolkata</h2>
<section id="toilet" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="toilet">Toilet</h3>
<p>It had been 78 years since Indian independence, but still we cannot resolve the situation with personal hygiene. We talk about how we developed personal hygiene standards on medieval times, which becomes the standard personal beauty care economy in modern world. But still the situation has worsened in India. It is so pathetic to see that we with the current government shouting about how we have become <em>Vishwa-Guru</em> but still we cannot provide clean toilets for the women in our modern trains and even any kind of long distance trains. Shame on us!</p>
<p>I felt it but never questioned it before when I was a kid. My mother, my sisters and even my father and brothers faced the same problem all throughout their life. And shame on me that it required to have a non-Indian partner to realise this issue. I was in Sealdah station where Charlotte has to go for toilet and then an employee from KFC told us that there is a toilet in first floor. I took her there and I was waiting for her to return. I was scared the whole time if she would return with a crying face. I mean I have seen the disgusting gent’s toilets in Howrah railway station. So I know what can be an obvious reaction to any kinds of public toilets in India. But fortunately she got a dried western toilet although she complained the floor was very dirty which I anticipated.</p>
</section>
<section id="people" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="people">People</h3>
<p>I have lived in West Bengal for 25 years of my life but I realised that I have no clue of my state as a whole, we can leave India out of discussion altogether. But what I am now more observant in this trip about the people here is they are like bunch of sticks tightly bound by a rope. The advantage of this kind of intertwined society is that if one individual falls, the others are so firmly holding that one does not fall completely but rather stay hung by a thread. Whereas the society in west is so individualistic that if one falls they go on descending on a free fall. But not everything is floral. The intertwined Bengali society does not at all give the people their individual free private space. And this can lead to conflicts and tension once an individual becomes adult and gets the sense of self-responsibility. So this showed me the dichotomy within me because until now I did not care or I did care but I was so far away with all the freedom that I need which never made me feel being observed or snatched away my privacy while I was vacationing in India. But this time it was different as it was with my partner. I felt it more.</p>
</section>
<section id="food" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="food">Food</h3>
<p>I always knew that food is a big thing in our Bengali culture. We talk about the last time’s food when we eat currently something. So one can see the obsession. But it is sometimes like bombardment. Once I have the breakfast, immediately I am called for lunch. After 15 mins I am again called for tiffin and again for something. This is crazy sometimes. Liking is good but obsession? I do not know. Maybe the ignorance of the reply to the question is due to me being Bengali.</p>
</section>
<section id="education" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="education">Education</h3>
<p>So one of my primary goal for this trip other than Tanay’s wedding is to visit Visvabharati University(VBU) and especially to meet Prof.&nbsp;Pranab Sarkar. He is the computational chemist in VBU. We went there and thought about meeting him. Unfortunately the university was closed due to Sunday. But after some time due to the help of abbu and Charlotte we saw one employee eating orange in front of the department. We got to know from him that PS sir upstairs and we visited him and it was a full 3 hours of useful discussions and nice conversations. I expressed him my interest to give a talk in the department once I am back to India next time when I am done with the defense.</p>
<p>But the sad part here was that even VBU being a central university the funding is so less and the less is very very less. I am astonished even with that few resources the students are publishing quality research. Kudos! We also talked to some PhD students about their feedback but they said ‘cannot complain’. This makes sense because as my friend Sujon Mandal says “you start to complain about things when you have a clear idea what things one is not getting”. The students at VBU or any other under funded universities in India do not even have an idea what their governments are not providing and what more it can provide. Like last time this time I also heard about the rising of the new private Universities like Ashoka and all. But I am really against this. The only reason is it will restrict the access the education to an average Indian student with not so good economic condition. Things won’t go in a good direction from here usually. Look at US.</p>
</section>
<section id="marriage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="marriage">Marriage</h3>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://raunakfarhaz.com/resources/posts/fraCcuFra/marriage.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" style="width:80.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So now we are at Tanay’s wedding ceremony. We could not attend the first 2 days because Charlotte became very sick. But we attended the wedding. I attended the Haldi ceremony too. It is a lavish wedding with no lack of resources. I enjoyed it I must say. I met all my old fellows, Sayantan, Ruchira and Anushka. Sreeja was there as well. I met some new people like Udit, Shreya, Ahana, Upashana and Shirsha. Most of them are corporate class people. But they are fun people. The environment of money was all around. But this is also true that without it one could not have this much fun. This pleasure maybe binds all of us into the Darwinism trap. Anyways I am waiting very much to take the flight back to Berlin as I have so much to do once I reach there.</p>
<p>I stop my journal here so that I enjoy the rest of the trip without any thoughts lingering behind my head. This trip came with many surprises, revelations, changes, exhaustion, sadness and happiness. But this trip would be a very memorable chapter in my life I believe.</p>
<p>Tschuss!</p>

  <title>Harmony</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Nature is very powerful than human beings. If you mess with nature even with a slightest bit, the whole mankind suffers a huge loss. Think about a situation like global warming which is making the headlines for many years now. But I think human-beings are either yet to understand the consequences or they are in denial. So, one of the direct impact that the glaciers melt and the sea level rises maybe by a little amount considering the vastness of the oceans. It can result into a deadly tsunami. Then we have outcries from global west about the climate protests that goes on which are mainly from a neoliberal and privileged classes of people. I feel the protests are a bit non-sensical if the awareness is not spread to the bottom of the societies. With the immense amount of neoliberalisation of economy as well as huge amount of industrialisation, we first created the divide into the societies in regards to access of education. Now with the tech-revolution we are creating a digital divide aka information divide as well. I believe we are lacking the sense of creating awareness among our children how to create a harmonious living within nature. Instead we are creating a pool of new life that are knowing how to artificially create nature around ourselves. Reports have shown that we are already the apex predator of our ecosystem already. The next thing that we are trying to do is also take control of the nature.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>I believe taking control of the nature for the human-beings is just like driving a car into a busy and crowded streets after getting 10 driving lessons from driving-school. We need to take it slow and patiently. Nature is lot greater and intelligent than us. We need to get long it with the nature’s flow rather than trying to get a grip on it. When in the morning I go for running and after 3 km, I feel a bit exhausted and my walking feels like gliding. At that moment I cross a man made alley of some ling trees that look like eucalyptus but they are not, I feel as if they are telling me something. The silence of the trees are so loud. I open my palms and stretch my fingers apart. The cold breeze flowing through the empty spaces between my fingers are so fulfilling and relaxing. We need to enjoy the nature naturally. But in the moment I see it as a very artificial act.</p>

<p>For the last two years Dibya and Ayan kept on complaining to me that I am not enthusiastic enough to organize a big vacation trip. So, one evening we were cooking in Ayan’s home, Dibya proposed this idea of booking the flight tickets to Greece before even chalking out the whole plan. I was drunk and intoxicated, so Dibya took the full advantage of it. Just kidding! We discussed and chose the time to be in the end of September because of following reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>expected to be less crowded</li>
<li>expected to be optimum warm/weather</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh! by the way I forgot to mention Sanju. He was also in this trip with us. He is the final member of this group that converted the <em>trio</em> to <em>quad</em>. And the only significance that he did to the group is to enable us to play the 29 card game (গোলাম যেখানে রাজা) in the trip. He will become the <code>Maharaj</code> of the trip later.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="santorini">Santorini</h2>
<p>We landed in Santorini on 25 Sep where our destination was a place called Kamari. Initially it looked like an oasis town. I have never been to Israel or Palestine. But from the pictures that I saw on instagram about it and when I saw it in person, it felt like I am in Israel or Palestine. It was a very rough and crude and dry landscape.</p>

<p>I was extremely tired and I also had a very mild sore throat from Berlin. Eventually I was neither enjoying or feeling good about the trip. And then we were so hungry that we chose a random restaurant/grill-house which had <span style="color: blue">4.4 stars rating in Google reviews</span>. The restaurant was called <a href="https://g.co/kgs/HNrpi7q"><strong>Happy Grill</strong></a>.</p>

<p>We took the following dishes from here</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Grill platter for 2</li>
<li>Moussaka</li>
<li>Caesar’s salad</li>
</ol>
<p>the feeling of the people for the food was actually bad. The grill platter was very dry, the moussaka was a disaster, and in my salad, the chicken was not well-grilled and has extreme amount of salad-dressing. So overall, <strong>not recommended</strong> at all.</p>

<section id="water-of-santorini" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="water-of-santorini">Water of Santorini</h3>
<p>As a part of my new routine, I woke up early at 5 am for 3 km jogging. It was so good and refreshing to run beside the beach with cool sea-breeze touching my face. The best part of it was when I entered the personal jacuzzi that we had in the roof of the hotel we were staying.</p>

<p>But then I found out that the beach of Kamari is very rocky, so we figured out that it is unswimmable. So next day which is on 26<sup>th</sup> September, we took a small boat ride to Perrisa where the beach was sandy. So we went there. For the first time in my life I found the most clear seawater although it was extremely salty too.</p>

<p>After the swimming, nobody knew that we are going to take the most daring thing for the trip. So, Dibya has made an international driving permit and we rented a car to travel to Oia. Oia is the most instagrammy place in Santorini. Most of the pictures related to Greece that you will see in the internet is actually shot at Oia. So we drove to Oia, in a nutshell Dibya surprisingly drove us smooth although we were all a bit scared. We reached finally to see the sunset at Oia and also to eat at the famous gyros food store of Santorini - <a href="https://pitogyros.com/"><strong>Pitogyros</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I did not feel anything special about Oia except the white hotels and homes on the sides of the mountain. It has very artificial vibes, as if everything is made perfect for photos. It felt like a place for the rich people to shop and stay. So, I would rather describe how the experience in Pitogyros was. Because after a horrible experience in Kamari food last night, we wanted definitely to have good food. We ordered</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong> : All of the dishes was amazing, my personal recommendation would be Pork Gyros plate, Chicken Souvlaki, and Soutzoukakia. My chicken souvlaki tastes a bit like <em>reshmi kabab</em> if you are familiar with Mughlai cuisine. The soutzoukakia was very tender, almost melting inside mouth. Pork Gyros was also very fatty but I would still go for Döner Kebab everytime. From my side if you are in Santorini, a must try place.</p>

<p>So after seeing the sunset which is in my opinion extremely overrated. We started returning to our hotel. And we were all very tired and I was feeling a bit ill with fever. I slept as soon as I reached the hotel. The boys stayed awake and had fun at night which I am completely unaware of and even if I know I do not want to reveal the truth. So next destination in the morning was Naxos. But before that see the গাঁয়ের ছেলে গোবিন্দ here.</p>

<p>I have very strong motion sickness. Hence, from the very beginning of the trip I was a bit skeptical about the ferry trips that we would be having in between islands. And the first of that was from Santorini to Naxos, our second destination. Surprisingly the weather was very calm, and the boat was lavish and giant. So, I could not even feel the vibrations from the ocean waves at all. It was a very comfotable journey. Although we had reserved seats, we spent most of our time on the deck practising and playing 29 card game. This game was a new addition to our group activities.</p>
<p>The ferry trip was very relaxing to me I repeat.</p>

<p>Finally we reached Naxos and we reached the villa we booked at <a href="https://naxosvillage.gr/">Naxos village hotel</a>. The villa was lavish and grand and peaceful with a very beautiful swimming pool. We were excited about Naxos more than other destinations from the beginning of the trip. The major reason for this was many of our colleagues from University advised and gave recommendations related to Naxos food scene. Being a group of Bengalis we are only interested in one thing - <strong>food</strong>. Anyways we can start one by one to mention the food scenes of Naxos. Some were really good, some were extremely bad and some were average.</p>
<section id="to-elliniko" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-elliniko">To Elliniko</h4>
<p><a href="https://toelliniko.com/">To Elliniko</a> was suggested by Ayan’s friend from Marseilles. This was by far the best place for Greek cuisine from my perspective in the whole trip. We went there twice. We ate there</p>
<ul>
<li>Moussaka</li>
<li>Kleftiko</li>
<li>Meat Balls with rice/fries</li>
<li>Baby goat</li>
<li>Bean salad</li>

<li>Fried Feta with honey</li>

<p>All of them were amazing. No doubt. I would recommend anyone to try all of them. Although we shared everything but I personally took ‘kleftiko’, so I can tell some more about it. It is a lamb stewed dish where carrots, garlic, onions, tomatoes, potatoes and lamb shank is put into a earthen small pot and convered with a paper and a string. Then the whole thing is slow roasted in oven for long time. The taste was 10 on 10. The meat was very tender. As I was on a very strict meal routine due to health issues. But this is the day where I cheated and ate red meat. As compensation I had to pay my girlfriend 10 Euros. Also since here I became a huge fan of the orange cake in general. All the other dishes were also good. And if you are a Bengali and you are thinking ‘baby goat’ would be same as ‘mutton’ or khasi(write in bengali), you are being mistaken. All the goat dishes have gamy flavour and mildly intense.</p>

<p>The next day I went for a morning walk as usual and then swam in the swimming pool. But for the lunch we went to a family run restaurant called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=boulamatsis+naxos&amp;t=bravened&amp;ia=web">Boulamatsis</a>. I find it very cute. The reason is that it is run by a mother with her two sons. And it is basically like a canteen.</p>

<p>I took the sea bass fish, it was so fulfilling and comfort food. The fish was fresh. Also the salad was amazing. Here we tried the first salad in Greece. Although my group were neither so much enthusiastic nor has a liking towards it. But after this, at least everyone joined me in the Greek salads wherever we went except Sanjay.</p>

<p>After the boulamatsis and its good food, we decided to play 29 card game in a bar where I ordered fruit salad with yoghurt and honey. And I got so hooked into it that I decided that it is going to be sometimes dinner when I am back in Berlin. It has not become a reality yet but soon.</p>

<p>Coming back to hotel we decided to play 29 game with betting. The bet was the team that loses the game has to sponsor the dinner for the winning team. Me and Dibya fought until the last game but we lost. And then we chose to go a sea-food restaurant called <a href="">Apanemi</a>. It was a disaster. We order multiple fish item. As Dibya does not like fish, he ordered a rib steak and later on sausages, as he could not eat that extremely dry steak. The sea food was also really shit. I cannot find a good word for it sorry. So we complained and the manager gave a discount. The only thing that was actually tasty was the salad with Naxian cheese which is also a goat cheese but a bit creamier and runny. I can only recommend that but nothing else. But still I am sharing one picture from the food pallete. It might look delicious but it is not.</p>

<p>We went to the beach of Naxos and as usual I have no words how to describe the water of the sea there. It was very clear and greenish like the retina color of an Azerbaijani woman. After the swim a gyros is must. I also ate yoghurt with honey there.</p>

<p>The night we had a great conversation about life, religion, society and ‘Moksha’. We cherished the last night at Naxos and the fresh cool breeze too. It was a very calm and mystic night. Next morning time to go to our last destination Mykonos island.</p>

<p>Did I already tell you about my sea sickness? I was about to go to Mykonos and I took a small boat. After the experience from the last ferry I was cvery confident about this time too. But “OH! MY GOD” I would never ever going to risk a boat ride. the weather was bad, stormy and the boat had to return to Naxos again. That was a relief, because we got a big ship the next time. So it was less painful.</p>

<p>The overall review about Mykonos is that it is a rich people’s place and I would not recommend anyone to go there to have fun. We ate a lot of cakes there. And that’s it we finished the Greece trip.</p>

<p>The Greece trip is tiring, started with fever, salty water, good food and bad food, emotional word sharing, quarrels, philosophy sharing but most importantly it was brotherly and relaxing.</p>

<p>It was Noah’s Grain day or in Bengali মুখে ভাত (Mukhe Bhaat), so I thought I would prepare something lesser spicy and fulfiiling and also I can cook it faster. So I prepared this.</p>

Ingredients
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li>1 kg Chicken (preferably with bone)</li>
<li>200 gm yoghurt</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D"> of a small garlic (grinded into a paste)</li>
<li>1.5 tablespoons of Kashmiri red chilli powder or sweet paprika powder</li>
<li>1.5 tablespoons of sugar</li>
<li>Salt to taste (2 tablespoons)</li>
<li>2 large red onions (sliced)</li>
<li>1.5 cups oil</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<section id="marination" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="marination">Marination</h3>
<p>Take a big bowl and put the washed chicken, yoghurt, salt and garlic paste together. Mix it well. And keep it to marinate 45 mins at least.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">

<p>Take a wok and heat it up with full heat, put some rapseed oil or sunflower oil into it and fry the sliced onions in medium heat until caramelized. Take out the caramelized onions.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">

Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>For best results in caramelizing onion one should use low heat. And take it out at 90% caramelized stage. If one makes it 100% on the stove then it can get burned afterwards with it’s remaining heat by self-cooking.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now put sugar into the hot oil where you already fried the onions. Let it melt and move the spatula in the meantime otherwise the melted sugar would form a lump. Once the sugar gets melted, put red chilli powder and fry it until the intense smell is almost gone. Now it is time to put the marinated chicken into the wok. Cook it in medium to high flame for 15 mins. The chicken would be boiled or tenderized with its own released water. No need to add additional water.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Once the water reduces and the raw smell of garlic is gone, put the flame to low and let it cook covered for 10 more mins or until the oil separates from the gravy. Turn off the heat, let it sit there on the stove for 5 more mins and then enjoy with rice.</p>
<p>I hope you like it, but Noah really cried even tasting a slight bit of it. I hope he would crave for it once he gets older ;)</p>

<p>I have been sick for a few days and the doctors have told me not to eat red meat which is one of the most favourite things of mine. But what can I do else than to follow her? So, Sanju one of my colleagues in here suggested that you can find good quality rohu fish</p>
