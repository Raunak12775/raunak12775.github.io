<p>Usually in the academic journals especially concerning computational chemistry or physical chemistry, Portable Document File (PDF) format is the choice for images in articles. I have been writing my Ph.D.&nbsp;thesis in these days using <code>Typst</code>. Those who are not familiar with it, it is a new programming language for typesetting. It can be seen as the alternative to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLaTeX">. It compiles very fast and is not heavy and slow like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLaTeX">. I learned it quite fast, it took me only 4 hours train journey to learn it. It should be clear by now that how low the learning curve is. And the better part is one does not need to wait 1 min to compile their large thesis. So I took the challenge to write my thesis in <code>Typst</code> which is not a common thing to do in our field as everyone is indoctrinated by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLaTeX">. I had only one fear while starting to write - most of my graphs and plots generated during my Ph.D.&nbsp;time is all in PDF file format. Some of the scripts I even lost. But I thought - “no problem I will convert them into SVG”. But then I found out that a development version of <code>Typst</code> is supporting the <code>PDF</code> file format as images. I used it and I was happy. But now I am even more happy to share you the news that <code>Typst</code> is supporting native <code>PDF</code> files as images in their latest release of 0.14. So more reasons to use <code>Typst</code> now. It is just as simple as the following syntax.</p>

<p>One note for VSCode users is - try to use the pre-release version of tinymist extension otherwise it might raise an error of “image type not supported”. I hope the tinymist team fixes it soon.</p>
</div>

<p>Until then enjoy. And yes I am very happy that I took the decision of writing my Ph.D.&nbsp;thesis in <code>Typst</code> and not in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLaTeX">. I enjoy so much seeing my writing being compiled almost with zero latency.</p>

  <title>Daddy Trump</title>

<p>With the advent of Ukraine war there is a huge political shift everywhere around the world. I am seeing global leaders shifting their blocs within a blink of an eye. This is not an unknown fact that politicians are the most fastest dress changers. But the obscenity of it is even more evident. The west bloc that comprises of European Union (EU) and United States (US) mostly (<em>to some extent Japan, Taiwan and South Korea and all those who have US bases in their countries</em>) is more shameless about the human rights they voice for. But anyways I am interested about the current situations, so I will stick to it. Very recently, the NATO secretary general called Trump the Daddy of the west bloc. Funnily, the leaders as well as the citizens of the west bloc, who were very concerned about the winning of Donald J. Trump in the last US elections, all of a sudden, sees hope in him. This might seem very weird but in politics it is often coined as <strong>diplomacy</strong>.</p>
<p>The next event that happens is that Ursula von der Leyen the chief of EU goes to US and brokers a trade deal that can become problematic for the steel as well as car industry for Germany and also for many more industries in EU. But she anyways accepts all the terms of Trump and comes back home. Recently, if you notice, all the european parliamentarians are working hand-in-hand from right to left, for eg from Meloni to Starmer via Merz or Macron, to make “Security Guarantees” for EU. Now those security guarantees are very vague in shape, nobody has discussed how US is going to give it. But they are all very sure about Trump being their DADDY!</p>
<p>The reason for my monologue is that somehow I believe that these EU leaders are putting too much trust in Trump. On the other hand Trump is only there for his own optics. How would he get the Nobel Peace Prize? How would he become well known to world by the title of “saviour of the world”? In reality he is not the saviour, rather he is making foundation beds for the rest of the wars that are going to come. He has all the possibilities to get himself out of the situation and tell the Europeans that he has done enough but could not solve it, so now it’s their problem and tell everyone goodbye. In the meantime, what EU is doing wrong by betting on US only and pushing the African Union, India and China to the opposite court, would lose the friends they would actually need in proper time. It is evident that all of the countries that EU is unfriending at the moment has major issues in their political system. But at the same time, EU itself has its own problems too, in terms of christian nationalism, muslim hatred, anti-black sentiment etc. If Russia is needed to be stopped it has to be done taking everyone to one side and russia on the other. In that case, even if US backs off, all the other parties are anyways stronger together than Russia alone. But betting on US only, which also reveals the white nationalistic mentality of EU, will bring more unpeace at the end.</p>

  <title>Accessibility is More Fundamental</title>

<p>I have grown up in a middle class family in West Bengal, India. The concept of private schools was not an alien thing, even at the remotest place I was born. My parents were not even middle class when I was born. But the anglicization of the education pushed my parents and also globalized psychology made them admit me into an English medium school. But the fees were very nominal because it was the only school in my town. So, my parents could afford it when I was young. Then, in 12<sup>th</sup> I went to a public school, after that, I went into a public university where the fees were even more negligible. I never had to carry the burden of high fees and that kind of stuff. And today I enjoyed that liberty and landed in a German public university for a doctoral study. The reason I am ranting about it is that I am not happy with the current situation that I see around the world about the affordability of education.</p>
<p>The worst of all is how the socialists, the liberals and the nationalist, all think that giving free education is like giving the public a free ride and looking at it as a loss for the government’s economy. That is completely garbage. Just think about all the great thinkers and the scientists of the previous age. They all are the product of the free public education. Some of them were also coming from a very poor background. The fees these days of most of the universities in India is skyrocketing and creating a divide for the whole society into 2 parts - one getting the education because of rich parents and other ones not getting education at all because of the economic condition they are trapped in. The latter condition has nothing the individuals are responsible of. Let’s look at the most celebrated degree of India and it’s total tuition fees in the prestigious institutes of India, the Indian Institute Technologies (IIT).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://raunakfarhaz.com/resources/posts/accessEdu/btech-tuition-total.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:95.0%"></p>
<figcaption>Bars representing the total tuition fees for IITs in a regular BTech degree. The numbers are only applicable to general category students.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The outrageous fees like one in IIT Guwahati which is 1,200,000 for 4 years, 300,000 per annum, 25,000 per month. Please, someone tell me how an aspiring kid from an economically backward society manage this amount of money for the tuition fees. Let’s do a simple <em>Gedankenexperiment</em> (thought experiment). Assume, on an economic perspective, there are 100 rich students and 100 poor students. Out of 100 in each category, there are 50 meritorious and 50 of the students that need help (non-meritorious). Now, while in an idealistic world, this segregation does not matter, because we have excellent motivating teachers. They would probably build everyone equally, irrespective of the merit. But in this hyper-capitalistic society, where our only goal is to shove degrees into the throat of the students, we will only consider the efficient students to be the torch-bearers. That would be done through a very complicated and unnecessary entrance examination to filter out the best. That exactly resembles Indian education system. Now, let’s say this exam is the perfect system to filter out the best out of total 200 students. This would result in 100 meritorious students from both rich and poor background. Wonderful, it looks to be equal, right?</p>
<p>Sorry to say, NO! Because, there is an additional filter called “counselling” and a stupid threshold called “cut-off”, where the so-called non-meritorious student lay behind the line and put into a waiting list to take the admission in the case of vacancy. For the case, let’s assume 50 out of the 100 non-meritorious students - 25 rich and 25 poor are in waiting list now. The admission starts, 50 rich kids would immediately take the admission due to abundance of wealth. Owing to the unexpected fees, the poor meritorious students cannot take the admission, even if they earned it, because of obvious reasons. Now, if we consider that 100 is the number of available seats, 50 are still vacant. Again, in this 25 poor non-meritorious students cannot take the admission while the 25 rich non-meritorious students will take the vacant seats. Lastly, we end up in 25 seats occupied with non-meritorious students and 25 empty unadmitted seats. You might think this is too simple to be true, but this is happening in real time in my country. This unaccessibility of education saddens me to the core. There are many questions that are also left unanswered here.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Did we succeed in capturing the thinkers of tomorrow with this unnecessary test?</li>
<li>Can we sustain as a society if we discard a major part of the society from the enlightenment?</li>
</ol>
<p>I do not think so. We need to get rid of the concept of trickle down of education like that of resources, which roots into imperialistic ideas. We need to voice our politicians, thinkers of the society, and bureaucrats, about what they are trying for our kids. But, everyone is silent and looking away from it. I am sorry to say you cannot do that for a long time.</p>

  <title>My Flashback of 2024</title>

</div>
<p>Last year that is 2024 was so many things together. It was very complicated with extreme emotional turmoils. But overall the year was much like a teacher to me. I learned many new things about me and I observed my life in a different way. I became much indisciplined than usual. So, when I did not listen to my body, my body made me stop and send me to the hospital. I was scared and lonely that night. Even I was accompanied by my partner’s mother, I was feeling extremely sad. I would always be indebted to my partner and her family for the support they have given me on that harsh time. I was crying at sudden times. Nothing was making me happy. What had happened to me? I had no clue. But now I have it. It is depression and anxiety. I went to a doctor. I was advised by my partner to do sports, 3 km running every morning. I started walking at first and then I started combination of running and walking. And finally after 1 and a half month I was running everyday 3 km.</p>
<p>This moment gave me a time to think about how I can actually achieve anything if I kept on doing the same task. Ability might be a thing but consistency is the key. From that moment onward, my view towards my life completely changed. I realized I was chasing something else that I might not want. Every moment of life is I think is an experiment. An experiment to refine the next experiment. I realized that I was overthinking about finishing my PhD and its quality. While this was not my goal at all. My goal is to actually feel myself and my consciousness while I am alive. My goal is to know me rather than thinking that getting my Ph.D.&nbsp;will give my identity. So I am trying to define myself with work. This feeling made me sure about the wrongs I was doing until now. I am running while I should have walked slowly and observed it. I got a feeling about what I like. I like people, I like to tell them stories. Now sometimes it can be fiction, sometimes something that I recently learnt or something that I have a good gut feeling for. But I do like to talk. And I love to teach. Now this do not need to be necessarily in a classroom setup. It can be through my writings. So I think my feeble idea of writing a book might become a reality. Let’s see what the new year brings to me. For now I am looking forward to Tanay and Rittika’s wedding and my India trip with my partner. I would like to experience what I bring this new year to myself. The only promise that I want to do to myself is that I would be honest with my actions rather than just doing it like a stone. Happy new year!</p>

  <title>Harmony</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Nature is very powerful than human beings. If you mess with nature even with a slightest bit, the whole mankind suffers a huge loss. Think about a situation like global warming which is making the headlines for many years now. But I think human-beings are either yet to understand the consequences or they are in denial. So, one of the direct impact that the glaciers melt and the sea level rises maybe by a little amount considering the vastness of the oceans. It can result into a deadly tsunami. Then we have outcries from global west about the climate protests that goes on which are mainly from a neoliberal and privileged classes of people. I feel the protests are a bit non-sensical if the awareness is not spread to the bottom of the societies. With the immense amount of neoliberalisation of economy as well as huge amount of industrialisation, we first created the divide into the societies in regards to access of education. Now with the tech-revolution we are creating a digital divide aka information divide as well. I believe we are lacking the sense of creating awareness among our children how to create a harmonious living within nature. Instead we are creating a pool of new life that are knowing how to artificially create nature around ourselves. Reports have shown that we are already the apex predator of our ecosystem already. The next thing that we are trying to do is also take control of the nature.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>I believe taking control of the nature for the human-beings is just like driving a car into a busy and crowded streets after getting 10 driving lessons from driving-school. We need to take it slow and patiently. Nature is lot greater and intelligent than us. We need to get long it with the nature’s flow rather than trying to get a grip on it. When in the morning I go for running and after 3 km, I feel a bit exhausted and my walking feels like gliding. At that moment I cross a man made alley of some ling trees that look like eucalyptus but they are not, I feel as if they are telling me something. The silence of the trees are so loud. I open my palms and stretch my fingers apart. The cold breeze flowing through the empty spaces between my fingers are so fulfilling and relaxing. We need to enjoy the nature naturally. But in the moment I see it as a very artificial act.</p>

<p>For the last two years Dibya and Ayan kept on complaining to me that I am not enthusiastic enough to organize a big vacation trip. So, one evening we were cooking in Ayan’s home, Dibya proposed this idea of booking the flight tickets to Greece before even chalking out the whole plan. I was drunk and intoxicated, so Dibya took the full advantage of it. Just kidding! We discussed and chose the time to be in the end of September because of following reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>expected to be less crowded</li>
<li>expected to be optimum warm/weather</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh! by the way I forgot to mention Sanju. He was also in this trip with us. He is the final member of this group that converted the <em>trio</em> to <em>quad</em>. And the only significance that he did to the group is to enable us to play the 29 card game (গোলাম যেখানে রাজা) in the trip. He will become the <code>Maharaj</code> of the trip later.</p>

<p>We landed in Santorini on 25 Sep where our destination was a place called Kamari. Initially it looked like an oasis town. I have never been to Israel or Palestine. But from the pictures that I saw on instagram about it and when I saw it in person, it felt like I am in Israel or Palestine. It was a very rough and crude and dry landscape.</p>

<p>I was extremely tired and I also had a very mild sore throat from Berlin. Eventually I was neither enjoying or feeling good about the trip. And then we were so hungry that we chose a random restaurant/grill-house which had <span style="color: blue">4.4 stars rating in Google reviews</span>. The restaurant was called <a href="https://g.co/kgs/HNrpi7q"><strong>Happy Grill</strong></a>.</p>

<p>We took the following dishes from here</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Grill platter for 2</li>
<li>Moussaka</li>
<li>Caesar’s salad</li>
</ol>
<p>the feeling of the people for the food was actually bad. The grill platter was very dry, the moussaka was a disaster, and in my salad, the chicken was not well-grilled and has extreme amount of salad-dressing. So overall, <strong>not recommended</strong> at all.</p>

<section id="water-of-santorini" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="water-of-santorini">Water of Santorini</h3>
<p>As a part of my new routine, I woke up early at 5 am for 3 km jogging. It was so good and refreshing to run beside the beach with cool sea-breeze touching my face. The best part of it was when I entered the personal jacuzzi that we had in the roof of the hotel we were staying.</p>

<p>But then I found out that the beach of Kamari is very rocky, so we figured out that it is unswimmable. So next day which is on 26<sup>th</sup> September, we took a small boat ride to Perrisa where the beach was sandy. So we went there. For the first time in my life I found the most clear seawater although it was extremely salty too.</p>

<p>After the swimming, nobody knew that we are going to take the most daring thing for the trip. So, Dibya has made an international driving permit and we rented a car to travel to Oia. Oia is the most instagrammy place in Santorini. Most of the pictures related to Greece that you will see in the internet is actually shot at Oia. So we drove to Oia, in a nutshell Dibya surprisingly drove us smooth although we were all a bit scared. We reached finally to see the sunset at Oia and also to eat at the famous gyros food store of Santorini - <a href="https://pitogyros.com/"><strong>Pitogyros</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I did not feel anything special about Oia except the white hotels and homes on the sides of the mountain. It has very artificial vibes, as if everything is made perfect for photos. It felt like a place for the rich people to shop and stay. So, I would rather describe how the experience in Pitogyros was. Because after a horrible experience in Kamari food last night, we wanted definitely to have good food. We ordered</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong> : All of the dishes was amazing, my personal recommendation would be Pork Gyros plate, Chicken Souvlaki, and Soutzoukakia. My chicken souvlaki tastes a bit like <em>reshmi kabab</em> if you are familiar with Mughlai cuisine. The soutzoukakia was very tender, almost melting inside mouth. Pork Gyros was also very fatty but I would still go for Döner Kebab everytime. From my side if you are in Santorini, a must try place.</p>

<p>So after seeing the sunset which is in my opinion extremely overrated. We started returning to our hotel. And we were all very tired and I was feeling a bit ill with fever. I slept as soon as I reached the hotel. The boys stayed awake and had fun at night which I am completely unaware of and even if I know I do not want to reveal the truth. So next destination in the morning was Naxos. But before that see the গাঁয়ের ছেলে গোবিন্দ here.</p>

<p>I have very strong motion sickness. Hence, from the very beginning of the trip I was a bit skeptical about the ferry trips that we would be having in between islands. And the first of that was from Santorini to Naxos, our second destination. Surprisingly the weather was very calm, and the boat was lavish and giant. So, I could not even feel the vibrations from the ocean waves at all. It was a very comfotable journey. Although we had reserved seats, we spent most of our time on the deck practising and playing 29 card game. This game was a new addition to our group activities.</p>
<p>The ferry trip was very relaxing to me I repeat.</p>

<p>Finally we reached Naxos and we reached the villa we booked at <a href="https://naxosvillage.gr/">Naxos village hotel</a>. The villa was lavish and grand and peaceful with a very beautiful swimming pool. We were excited about Naxos more than other destinations from the beginning of the trip. The major reason for this was many of our colleagues from University advised and gave recommendations related to Naxos food scene. Being a group of Bengalis we are only interested in one thing - <strong>food</strong>. Anyways we can start one by one to mention the food scenes of Naxos. Some were really good, some were extremely bad and some were average.</p>

<p>All of them were amazing. No doubt. I would recommend anyone to try all of them. Although we shared everything but I personally took ‘kleftiko’, so I can tell some more about it. It is a lamb stewed dish where carrots, garlic, onions, tomatoes, potatoes and lamb shank is put into a earthen small pot and convered with a paper and a string. Then the whole thing is slow roasted in oven for long time. The taste was 10 on 10. The meat was very tender. As I was on a very strict meal routine due to health issues. But this is the day where I cheated and ate red meat. As compensation I had to pay my girlfriend 10 Euros. Also since here I became a huge fan of the orange cake in general. All the other dishes were also good. And if you are a Bengali and you are thinking ‘baby goat’ would be same as ‘mutton’ or khasi(write in bengali), you are being mistaken. All the goat dishes have gamy flavour and mildly intense.</p>

<p>The next day I went for a morning walk as usual and then swam in the swimming pool. But for the lunch we went to a family run restaurant called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=boulamatsis+naxos&amp;t=bravened&amp;ia=web">Boulamatsis</a>. I find it very cute. The reason is that it is run by a mother with her two sons. And it is basically like a canteen.</p>

<p>I took the sea bass fish, it was so fulfilling and comfort food. The fish was fresh. Also the salad was amazing. Here we tried the first salad in Greece. Although my group were neither so much enthusiastic nor has a liking towards it. But after this, at least everyone joined me in the Greek salads wherever we went except Sanjay.</p>

<p>After the boulamatsis and its good food, we decided to play 29 card game in a bar where I ordered fruit salad with yoghurt and honey. And I got so hooked into it that I decided that it is going to be sometimes dinner when I am back in Berlin. It has not become a reality yet but soon.</p>

<p>Coming back to hotel we decided to play 29 game with betting. The bet was the team that loses the game has to sponsor the dinner for the winning team. Me and Dibya fought until the last game but we lost. And then we chose to go a sea-food restaurant called <a href="">Apanemi</a>. It was a disaster. We order multiple fish item. As Dibya does not like fish, he ordered a rib steak and later on sausages, as he could not eat that extremely dry steak. The sea food was also really shit. I cannot find a good word for it sorry. So we complained and the manager gave a discount. The only thing that was actually tasty was the salad with Naxian cheese which is also a goat cheese but a bit creamier and runny. I can only recommend that but nothing else. But still I am sharing one picture from the food pallete. It might look delicious but it is not.</p>

<p>Did I already tell you about my sea sickness? I was about to go to Mykonos and I took a small boat. After the experience from the last ferry I was cvery confident about this time too. But “OH! MY GOD” I would never ever going to risk a boat ride. the weather was bad, stormy and the boat had to return to Naxos again. That was a relief, because we got a big ship the next time. So it was less painful.</p>

<p>The overall review about Mykonos is that it is a rich people’s place and I would not recommend anyone to go there to have fun. We ate a lot of cakes there. And that’s it we finished the Greece trip.</p>

<p>It was Noah’s Grain day or in Bengali মুখে ভাত (Mukhe Bhaat), so I thought I would prepare something lesser spicy and fulfiiling and also I can cook it faster. So I prepared this.</p>

<p>Take a big bowl and put the washed chicken, yoghurt, salt and garlic paste together. Mix it well. And keep it to marinate 45 mins at least.</p>

<p>Take a wok and heat it up with full heat, put some rapseed oil or sunflower oil into it and fry the sliced onions in medium heat until caramelized. Take out the caramelized onions.</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>For best results in caramelizing onion one should use low heat. And take it out at 90% caramelized stage. If one makes it 100% on the stove then it can get burned afterwards with it’s remaining heat by self-cooking.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now put sugar into the hot oil where you already fried the onions. Let it melt and move the spatula in the meantime otherwise the melted sugar would form a lump. Once the sugar gets melted, put red chilli powder and fry it until the intense smell is almost gone. Now it is time to put the marinated chicken into the wok. Cook it in medium to high flame for 15 mins. The chicken would be boiled or tenderized with its own released water. No need to add additional water.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Once the water reduces and the raw smell of garlic is gone, put the flame to low and let it cook covered for 10 more mins or until the oil separates from the gravy. Turn off the heat, let it sit there on the stove for 5 more mins and then enjoy with rice.</p>
<p>I hope you like it, but Noah really cried even tasting a slight bit of it. I hope he would crave for it once he gets older ;)</p>
